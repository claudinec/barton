# Contributing

This is a crowd sourced project and it needs your help.  Updating the details of politicians is super easy & no programming experience or skill is needed.  Just follow these steps:

1. Create a [github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
2. Check the [issues](https://github.com/experimentsindemocracy/barton/issues) to see which jurisdictions need work or open a [new one](https://github.com/experimentsindemocracy/barton/issues/new).  
3. [Fork](https://github.com/experimentsindemocracy/barton/fork) the repo and create an appropriately named branch e.g. `au-local-brisbane`.
4. Add or update the jurisdiction's contact details.
5. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).  In your message, include `closes #27` or what every issue number you are working on.
6. Pour a cup of tea, enjoy a bickie and reflect on your contribution to open democracy.  Thanks!
