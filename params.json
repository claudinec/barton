{"name":"Barton","tagline":"A repository of political wisdom - structured contact details for all elected officials in Australia.","body":"# Barton\r\n\r\n> No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom.\r\n>\r\n> -- Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia [12 Aug 2013](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/liberals-squirm-as-abbott-refers-to-the-suppository-of-wisdom-20130812-2rryy.html)\r\n\r\nBarton is a ~~suppository~~ repository of political wisdom.  More specifically though, it's a structured collection of crowd sourced contact details for all elected officials in Australia, designed for future consumption by APIs and apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## File Structure\r\n\r\nThe repo is a simple collection of [YAML files](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).  Each YAML file in the `data/` directory represents the jurisdiction of a single political authority.   \r\n\r\nThe following data conventions will serve as the public API.\r\n\r\n- `Files` MUST only contain a single jurisdiction of political authority.\r\n\r\n- `Files` SHOULD be named descriptively so that jurisdictions will group appropriately by the file system i.e. `au-local-qld-brisbane-city-council.yaml`  \r\n\r\n- `Files` MUST contain a `name` field.  Files MAY contain `tags` and `people` collections.  \r\n\r\n- `People` MUST be a collection.\r\n\r\n- `People` elements MUST contain a `name` field, as well as `roles`, and `contact` collection.  `People` elements MAY contain any other fields as required, including `title`, `salutation`, `suffix`, `party`.\r\n\r\n- `Name` fields are strings with the format `First [Middle] ['Preferred'] Lastnames`\r\n\r\n- `Contact` collections MUST contain `office` elements. \r\n\r\n- `Tags` MUST contain a collection of strings which SHOULD apply to an element and all of its children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an excerpt from the Queensland state government\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    name: Queensland Government\r\n    tags: [Queensland, state]\r\n    people: \r\n      - name: Verity Mary Barton\r\n        salutation: Dear Miss\r\n        suffix: MP\r\n        roles:\r\n         - Member for Broadwater\r\n        party: LNP\r\n        contact:\r\n         - office: Electorate\r\n           address: 102 Imperial Parade, (Cnr Government Rd and Imperial Pde), Labrador Qld  4215\r\n           postal: PO Box 644, Labrador Qld 4215\r\n           email: broadwater@parliament.qld.gov.au\r\n           phone: 07 5563 9010\r\n           fax: 07 5500 5364\r\n      - name: Campbell Kevin 'Can Do' Newman\r\n        title: The Honourable\r\n        salutation: Dear Premier    \r\n        suffix: MP\r\n        roles:\r\n          - Premier of Queensland\r\n          - Member for Ashgrove\r\n        party: LNP\r\n        contact:\r\n          - office: Ministerial\r\n            address: Level 15, Executive Building, 100 George Street, Brisbane Qld 4000\r\n            postal: PO Box 15185, City East Qld 4002\r\n            email: thepremier@premiers.qld.gov.au Shop 2, 230 Waterworks Road, Ashgrove Qld 4060\r\n            phone: 07 3719 7000\r\n            fax: 07 3220 6222        \r\n          - office: Electorate\r\n            postal: PO Box 3010, Ashgrove East Qld 4060\r\n            email: ashgrove@parliament.qld.gov.au\r\n            phone: 07 3366 6000\r\n            fax: 07 3366 6202\r\n   \r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo access the most up-to-date politician contact details, simply clone, curl, or scrape the repo.  Parse the YAML into your preferred data format and use it to find a politician, write to your representative, or start a revolution - implementation is up to you. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBarton is a collective endeavour that needs your assistance.
