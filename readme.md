> No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom.

> -- Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia [12 Aug 2013](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/liberals-squirm-as-abbott-refers-to-the-suppository-of-wisdom-20130812-2rryy.html)

Barton is a ~~suppository~~ repository of political wisdom.  More specifically though, it's a structured collection of crowd sourced contact details for all elected officials in Australia, designed for consumption by APIs and apps.

Despite the interwebs being around for over 20 years, a complete database of Australian politician contact details still doesn't exist.  Many government websites already provide data as `mail-merge.docx` or `contact-details.pdf` for download.  Unfortunately, none of them use a consistent structure or format suitable for automated consumption.

Barton seeks to rectify this problem.


## Usage

To access the most up-to-date politician contact details, simply clone, curl, or scrape the repo.  Parse the YAML into your preferred data format and use it to find a politician, write to your representative, or start a revolution - implementation is up to you. 


## File Structure

The repo is a simple collection of [YAML files](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).  Each YAML file in the `data/` directory represents the jurisdiction of a single political authority.   

The following data conventions will serve as the public API.

- `Files` MUST start with 3 dashes `---`.
- `Files` MUST only contain a single jurisdiction of political authority.
- `Files` SHOULD be named descriptively so that jurisdictions will group appropriately by the file system i.e. `au-qld-local-brisbane-city-council.yaml`  
- `Files` MUST contain a `name` field.  Files MAY contain `tags` and `people` collections.
- `Tags` MUST contain a collection of strings which SHOULD apply to the current element and all of its children.

    
```    
---
name: People's Democratic Banana Republic
tags: [tags are strings, they apply to this, and all children]
people: 
  - name: Barry Crocker
``` 
    
- `People` MUST be a collection.
- `People` elements MUST contain a `name` field, as well as `roles` and `contact` collections.
- `People` elements MAY contain any other fields as required, including `title`, `tags`, `salutation`, `suffix`, `party`.
- `Name` fields are strings with the format `First [Middle] ['Preferred'] Lastnames`
- `Contact` collections MUST contain at least one `office` elements. 

```    
- name: Barry 'Bazza' Crocker
  roles:
   - Minister for Political Entitlements
   - Member for Woolloomooloo
  contact:
    electorate:
     address: Corner Cowper Wharf Roadway & Brougham Road, Woolloomooloo, NSW 2011
     postal: PO Box 122, Sydney NSW 2001
     email: bazza@parliament.nsw.gov.au
     phone: 02 9357 3074

  party: LNP
  title: The Right Honourable
  salutation: Dear Minister
  suffix: MP
  tags: [Pies & Mash, Gravy, Schooners]
```

Putting it all together yields something like:
